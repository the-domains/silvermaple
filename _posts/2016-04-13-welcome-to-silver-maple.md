Welcome to Silver Maple

Acer saccharinum, commonly known as silver maple, creek maple, silverleaf maple, soft maple, water maple, swamp maple, or white maple---is a species of maple native to eastern and central North America in the eastern United States and Canada. It is one of the most common trees in the United States.

Many consider it the "weed" of maples because of its vigor and tolerance for varied growing conditions.

The silver maple tree is a relatively fast-growing deciduous tree, commonly reaching a height of 15--25 m (49--82 ft), exceptionally 35 m (115 ft). Its spread will generally be 11--15 m (36--49 ft) wide. A 10-year-old sapling will stand about 8 m (26 ft) tall. It is often found along waterways and in wetlands, leading to the colloquial name "water maple". It is a highly adaptable tree, although it has higher sunlight requirements than other maple trees. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/08f69fa1674cb91d66199f78060ad404847625c6.png)

The leaves are simple and palmately veined, 8--16 cm long and 6--12 cm broad, with deep angular notches between the five lobes. The 5--12 cm long, slender stalks of the leaves mean that even a light breeze can produce a striking effect as the downy silver undersides of the leaves are exposed.
